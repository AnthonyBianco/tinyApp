# TinyApp Project

Welcome to TinyApp!

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs. 

What does that mean? 

Have you ever wanted to post a link to a news article, online product, or something else on your social media account, but the link you copied turns out to look like this:

https://www.amazon.ca/Berserker-Amon-Amarth/dp/B07NRF2FHC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1Z2W4IJ3CUHMK&keywords=amon+amarth&qid=1570305610&sprefix=amon+%2Caps%2C190&sr=8-1

Well TinyApp can fix that! TinyApp allows you to create a short URL that you can use for social media posts. So instead of,

"Hey guys, I just saw this awesome band last night. Check out their album by clicking here: https://www.amazon.ca/Berserker-Amon-Amarth/dp/B07NRF2FHC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1Z2W4IJ3CUHMK&keywords=amon+amarth&qid=1570305610&sprefix=amon+%2Caps%2C190&sr=8-1
"

You can post:

"Hey guys... yuebar (shortened link)"

Follow along below for a demonstration below.
